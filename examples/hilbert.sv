# Hilbert style proof checker

The Hilbert-style proof system is a formal deductive framework used in mathematical logic and
proof theory. It is named after David Hilbert, who pioneered formal approaches to mathematics
in the early 20th century. This system is designed to formalize reasoning by providing a small
set of axioms and inference rules that allow the derivation of theorems. In its essence, the
Hilbert-style proof system is minimalistic, relying on a few foundational logical axioms and a
single or limited number of inference rules, such as modus ponens (if `A` and `A -> B` are
true, then `B` is true).

Hilbert-style proof systems can be applied to type checking in programming by leveraging their
formal structure to verify the correctness of type assignments in a program. In type theory,
types can be seen as logical propositions, and well-typed programs correspond to proofs of these
propositions. By encoding typing rules as axioms and inference rules within a Hilbert-style
framework, the process of type checking becomes equivalent to constructing a formal proof that
a given program adheres to its type specification. While this approach is conceptually elegant,
it can be inefficient for practical programming languages due to the systemâ€™s minimalistic
nature, requiring explicit proofs for even simple derivations. However, it provides a
foundational theoretical basis for understanding type systems and their connection to logic,
particularly in frameworks like the Curry-Howard correspondence, which bridges formal logic and
type theory.

## Instructions for using the proof checker:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------
To compose a proof, use these rules
--------------------------------------------------------------
(CONST A) = (const A)
(IMPL A B) = (impl A B)
I = (impl A A)
K = (impl A (impl B A))
S = (impl (impl A (impl B C)) (impl (impl A B) (impl A C)))
((impl A B) A) = B
--------------------------------------------------------------
