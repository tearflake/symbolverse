# IMP interpreter

IMP is a simple, foundational framework often used to illustrate the principles of imperative
programming in programming language theory and formal semantics. It stands for Imperative language,
and typically includes a minimal set of constructs such as variable assignments, sequential
composition, conditional statements, and while loops. Despite its simplicity, IMP captures the
essential features of imperative programming, where programs are viewed as sequences of commands
that modify a programâ€™s state. It serves as a useful model for teaching operational and
denotational semantics, allowing researchers and students to formally reason about program
behavior, correctness, and transformations in a structured yet approachable way.

This example expects input in the following BNF:

```
   <program> := (imp <statement>)

 <statement> := <assignment>
              | <sequence>
              | <if>
              | <while>
              | skip

<assignment> := (assign <IDENTIFIER> <expression>)

  <sequence> := (seq <statement>+)

        <if> := (if <boolean> <statement> <statement>)

     <while> := (while <boolean> <statement>)

<expression> := <NUMBER>
              | <IDENTIFIER>
              | (add <expression> <expression>)
              | (sub <expression> <expression>)
              | (mul <expression> <expression>)
              | (div <expression> <expression>)

   <boolean> := true
              | false
              | (eq <expression> <expression>)
              | (leq <expression> <expression>)
              | (not <boolean>)
              | (and <boolean> <boolean>)
              | (or <boolean> <boolean>)
